In my course tenure, I completed many assignments in Java-J2EE technologies. With these skills, I grabbed an opportunity to work with  Societe Generale. I worked for this company 3 years in various java technologies like Core java, Spring,Hibernate, Git, REST API. I have developed UI components using Angular JS, Node JS, Ez-web (internal tool), HTML,CSS, Java Script. Along with this technical stack, I gained good knowledge in Banking Domain in my 3 years experience. 

##I am a fast learner, always curios to explore new technologies. I wish web server programming provides me challenging learnings and enhance my skills into next level. Going forward, will do assignments in Node Js, CSS, Bootstrap which provides me more confidence and practical experience. After finishing this, I can see my self as better Web design engineer.
